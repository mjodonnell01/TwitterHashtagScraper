# TwitterHashtagScraper
This uses selenium and beautiful soup to scrape Twitter hashtags for post text. I don't know if Twitter would try and get me and trouble for using this, but their API is awful (I am also not paying for it) and this is a project for school through ASU. I have 0 intentions to use this to make money or anything of the sort.
