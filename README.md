# TwitterHashtagScraper
This uses selenium and beautiful soup to scrape Twitter hashtags for post text. I don't know if Twitter would try and get me and trouble for using this, but their API is awful (I am also not paying for it) and this is a project for school through ASU. I have 0 intentions to use this to make money or anything of the sort. 

NOTE: I am not a Trump supporter. I was trying to see how easy it was to create a bot that could mimic political talk on social media. This was during the time where there was a lot of discussion in the news around Russian political bots on the web.
